# satellite
This code shows how to use the state vectors of spacecraft A and B to find the position, velocity and acceleration of B relative to A in the LVLH (local vertical-local horizontal) frame attached to A. I am trying to numerically decode the basic equation of the relative two-body motion to obtain the orbit of spacecraft B relative to spacecraft A and the distance between the two satellites. At the same time, I print the shortest and farthest distances of the satellites to each other on the screen as output.
